§5So here you are.

§5At the end of a tale of mistakes and regrets.

§5Knowing the truth in its entirety.

§5Or perhaps you killed the Enderdragon.

§5By any means, you're stuck here with me for the meantime.

§5Here in the void between the realms.

§5Or perhaps you may decide to skip this visitation as usual and awake immediately at your destination. You'd have no shame in doing so.

§5But I would appreciate you entertaining an inquiry of mine before I depart one final time.

§5Seeing as you have successfully followed my path through the majority of my failures, I would like to ask you a question:

§5Was it worth it?

§5Were all my efforts to mask my mistakes and amend my errors fruitful?

§5Or did I leave all that I treasured in vain?

§5Even here, I am unable to see the home I loved, whether it is thriving as it once was, or desolate as I left it.

§5So tell me, did the world recover?

§5Or is it laid to waste?

§5And did I suffer in vain?

§5These centuries of restlessness in the void, watching countless souls traverse the empty canvas, each one wholly unaware of the time expended, has left me cynical of the hope I left my home for.

§5And decade upon decade, the remembrance of my mistakes would gnaw at what was left of my meager soul.

§5I never forgave myself for my failure.

§5But today, seeing you arise from Pandemonium has reignited that same hope.

§5And perhaps, if that hope is true, I may finally have peace.

§5So tell me, did you put an end to that monstrosity I invented?

§5Did you restore balance to the realms?

§5Did you undo my damage?

§5And may I rest in peace?
